SourceHubIT_SpeechRecognition
A Python-based Speech Recognition System that converts spoken words into text using the SpeechRecognition library. Includes optional text-to-speech playback and a simple GUI built with Tkinter. Great for practicing real-time audio input, API integration, and Python GUI development.

🎙 Speech Recognition System in Python

This project is a simple yet powerful Speech Recognition System built using Python. It captures spoken input from the microphone, converts it to text using Google's Speech Recognition API, and optionally reads the text aloud using a Text-to-Speech engine. The project includes both a GUI version (using Tkinter) and a CLI version for flexibility.


🚀 Features

- 🎤 Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- 🔊 Text-to-speech playback using pyttsx3
- 🖼 Simple GUI interface with Tkinter
- 🌐 Optional web-based version using Flask
- 🧪 CLI version for quick testing

📌Notes
Requires internet connection for Google Speech API.

Works best in a quiet environment with a functioning microphone.

You can customize the voice and speed in pyttsx3 if desired.
